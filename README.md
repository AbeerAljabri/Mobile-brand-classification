# Mobile-brand-classification

### About the project
This project uses techspecs API to collect smartphone data. Each row represents a single smartphone, while the columns show the Name, Display Size, Display Resolution, Camera Resolution, color, Operating System, Width and Weight, and Brand.

Following visualization and cleaning, four models (LogisticRegression, SVC, DecisionTreeClassifier, and RandomForestClassifier) were used to categorize the smartphones based on their brands. Then we evaluate them to choose the best model.
